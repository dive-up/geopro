# geopro

Geopro was built as an exercise to showcase my skills.

Data: [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all\_month.csv](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.csv)

Tools:

Vite | React | TypeScript | Recharts | TailwindCSS | CSV-Parser

CSV-Parser was used to parse the provided csv file to JSON format for implementation.

To see the project working, follow the below steps:

1.  Clone the repository using “git clone”
    
2.  Open the directory in the terminal by right-clicking or using terminal
    
3.  Change directory to “geopro-fr” and type the command “npm install” to install project dependencies.
    
4.  Type the command “npm run dev” to run a development server.
    
5.  Ctrl / Cmd + Click or Copy the link in the terminal (such as “http://localhost:5173”)
    
6.  Checkout the working project.
    

Thanks for taking time to looking at my code.
